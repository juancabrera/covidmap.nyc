      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>NYC COVID map is a voluntary and anonymous location based mobile app designed to provide you with the latest
        COVID data around you in order to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.</p>
      <p>The use of this app is completely voluntary, and it can be downloaded for free on iOS and Android
        smartphones.</p>
      <p>Privacy is protected by not saving or sending your location data. Location data is only used to detect if you
        move from one zip code to another and notify you with the latest COVID data of your current zone. You can
        still use the app without granting location access permissions.</p>

      <h2>Independent project</h2>
      <p>NYC COVID map was designed and developed 100% by two individuals as a personal side project, there are no
        affiliations to any private or public organizations.</p>

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>The app uses only official data released by “The City of New York”:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zip Code Tabulation Areas, <a
            href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Modified-Zip-Code-Tabulation-Areas-MODZCTA-Map/5fzm-kpwv"
            target="_blank">from NYC
            OpenData</a></li>
        <li>COVID-19 daily data, <a href="https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data" target="_blank">NYC Health
            Github</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>If location access permission is granted, the app will check your location approximately every 15 minutes to
        check if you moved into another zip code area, if so, the app will send you a “location changed” notification
        with the latest COVID data of the current zip code area.</p>
      <p>If location access permission is declined, you can still use the app and see latest COVID data in other zip
        codes areas by taping them, you won’t be able to get any notifications.</p>
      <p>Location data is not saved or sent anywhere, it’s only used for notifications purposes.</p>
